		Most likely the domain will be <a href='http://3dstownsquare.com' target='_blank'>http://3dstownsquare.com</a>. This is to make sure people trust the domain instead of cheaping out on a TK domain.
			<br/>On day of release, this page will redirect to <b>3dstownsquare.com</b> and no longer be a notice
